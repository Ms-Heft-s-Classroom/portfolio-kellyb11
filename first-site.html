                <br>
                <p1>I really enjoy just being outside. It's an escape everytime I leave a place even if I had a great time there because I'm in an open area and there is fresh air. I make a habit of just looking up and seeing the sky no matter what: day or night, cloudy or clear. Just look up and see the amazing swirls or colors.</p1>

                <br>
                <p1>Most people are naturally drawn to water which makes sense because we need it to survive. I enjoy swimming and even just dipping my toes in most any body of water I encounter. Take some time to stare out over water and let your mind wander or concentrate on the small details of the lake or river. I will suggest only observing ponds and other water areas with larger amounts of biology.</p1>

                <h3>#3 Plants</h3>
                <br>
                <p1>Taking a walk through a forest or park and looking at the little things helps you center your mind because you have to slow down and careful scan for tiny details. There are leaves covering the ground from previous seasons and the smallest creatures can come into view. Note the design and feel of the tree bark around you is also wonderful. Not everyone is close to trees though. I love observing flowers or smaller plants in downtown areas.</p1>

                <br>
                <p1>If you go camping, you probably build a fire. S'mores and stories either memories or made up are amazing. You can also enjoy the warmth thrown off by the fire. The flames are beautiful as they jump up and die down. My favorite part of fires is when they just smouldering and have lovely glowing embers under charred wood. The contentment I feel when I'm in my backyard or in the middle of the nowhere beside a fire is unmatched.</p1>

                <br>
                <p1>I welcome the sound of rain whether it's a quiet drops on the roof or driving, pounding sheets of thunderstorms. The smell, sight, sound, or feel of rain of some of my favorites! Rain is lovely and letting it make you laugh from the joy of racing to your car or droplets running down your windows bring small moments of happiness.</p1>

                <br>
                <p1>Snow means fun outside at home with snowballs, fort building, and sledding. Snow can also mean snowboardign and skiing down mountains and hills. But my favorite part of winter is seeing the landscape covered in a pristine blanket. I love the silence in the middle of winter when everything is asleep. Find joy in the activities and the scenary brought by Snow.</p1>
