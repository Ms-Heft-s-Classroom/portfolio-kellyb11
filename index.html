        <h2>My First Website</h2>
        <p>This is the first project I worked on in my high school coding class. It uses basic html and css to format and style the content. The topics of our websites were personal choices. My website is called "a few things to find joy in" and lists small things in nature I love.</p>

        <h2>TBD</h2>
        <p>Description of second website.</p>

        <h3>Intro To Coding Class</h3>
        <p>My high school offers a computer science class that gives students a crash course in the basics of multiple coding languages. Over the course of a semester, the class covers HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) principles, tags, and shortcuts. Then we move onto CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which allows programmers to decorate their content and formatting without crowding their code with text.</p>

        <h3>My Skills</h3>
        <p>After taking this class, I have a good understanding of how to write, read and correct HTML and CSS. </p>
